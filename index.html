  <h2>Biography</h2>
  <p>Sean Wolcott is a Seattle-based graphic designer, currently working as Senior Art Director at Microsoft. Besides creating user interfaces and experiences for products used by millions, Mr. Wolcott runs his own practice, Rationale, where he designs identities, packaging, signage, publications, websites, and user interfaces for a wide array of clients.</p>

  <p>His work reflects a holistic philosophy of design and a visual language, which aims at rational, objective expression that can appropriately convey clients' values. For Mr. Wolcott, design is not a matter of style, but rather a logical, problem-solving process that leads to timeless solutions.</p>

  <p>Mr. Wolcott had the privilege of studying under Massimo Vignelli, whose teachings continue to inform his philosophy and propel his craft to higher standards of excellence.</p>

  <p>His work is often featured in online and printed publications, and he has been nominated by Mr. Vignelli as one of the six top American graphic designers today under the age of 50, for which his works will be exhibited in the US and Italy in the fall of 2015.</p>

  <p>Mr. Wolcott is also a teacher at the School of Visual Concepts (SVC) in Seattle, where he teaches corporate identity and user interface design courses. His efforts to inform and promote a better design culture are also reflected in his lecturing activity as an international speaker, having lectured several times in the United States, as well as in European countries.</p>
